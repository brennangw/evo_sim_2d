evo_sim_2d
==========

An "evolution" simulation using the Processing language. It is more complicated then evo 1d with predator and prey, as well as, more freddom of movement. Sourceforge hosts copies of the application: http://sourceforge.net/projects/evolution2d/?source=directory. They hopefully work, I can't guarntee how well Processing exports applications. Enjoy!
